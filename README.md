## Introduction
WIZARD is a system designed for form management. It comprises a collection of models enabling users to input and refine data within the system, with each model containing input control elements such as CheckBoxes, TextBoxes, and Labels. 

HTML, CSS, and JS, along with Node.js, were utilized to craft the dynamic user interface. Additionally, Node.js was employed for REST API programming, while MongoDB served as the data storage solution.

<br>
We built a website that allows you to manage a system of WIZARDS, with three users:
1) **User**: Users are responsible for inputting values into the wizard forms.
2) **WIZARD CREATOR**: WIZARD CREATOR has the privilege to add new wizards, edit existing ones, and delete the wizards they added.
3) **ADMIN**: The ADMIN role has access to view all wizard results. Additionally, admins have the authority to modify user roles and delete wizards from the system.

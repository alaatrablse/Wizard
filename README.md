# Wizard
The project I am currently working on is similar to one I completed in the past, but with some enhancements to the user experience. Additionally, we have migrated from using the ASP.net API to Node.js and MongoDB for our API needs.


The subject of the software project: MANAGER WIZARD
• The software will make it possible to manage a system of WIZARDS
• WIZARD is a collection of forms that allow users to enter input data into the system and refine them. All forms contain input controls such as: CheckBox, TextBox, LABEL

We built a website that allows you to manage a system of WIZARDS, with three users:
1) user: will fill in the wizard values.
2) WIZARD CREATOR: will be able to add a wizard, edit and delete a wizard he added.
3) ADMIN: can view all the results of the wizards, can change the type of user and delete a wizard

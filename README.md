## Introduction
The software aims to facilitate the management of the WIZARD processing system by users. WIZARD consists of a set of models that allow users to input and optimize system data. All models contain input control elements such as CheckBox, TextBox, and LABEL.

HTML, CSS & Bootstrap, and JS were used along with Node.js to program the dynamic user interface. Additionally, Node.js was used to program the REST API, and MongoDB was utilized as the database system for data storage.
<br><br>
<br>
We built a website that allows you to manage a system of WIZARDS, with three users:
1) **User**: Users are responsible for inputting values into the wizard forms.
2) **WIZARD CREATOR**: WIZARD CREATOR has the privilege to add new wizards, edit existing ones, and delete the wizards they added.
3) **ADMIN**: The ADMIN role has access to view all wizard results. Additionally, admins have the authority to modify user roles and delete wizards from the system.
